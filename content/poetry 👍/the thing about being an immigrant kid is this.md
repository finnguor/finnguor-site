and the thing about being an immigrant kid is this: the way i lash out at my mother sounds the exact same, intonation and all, as the way she talks to her mother over the phone, and i hate her with all my guts but love her with all my heart. i wish i had never known her and i knead her head when it aches. there is a festering thing inside me that is black and withered, bitter for this forced legacy - an honour, they say, so maybe it is more like one of those dried goji berries that she puts in the rice porridge we make on sunday mornings. and i never went to church, but i still felt like a mortal in the presence of god - how could i not, how could my parents be human? they were godlike in power, godlike in the way they cared so very much and so very little for me, always, always, in the wrong way. the thing about being an immigrant kid is this: how do you learn to be loved when all you've ever known is harsh reprimand, warm rice porridge, and filial piety?
