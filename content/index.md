# HI ! FINN GUO HERE !

> (the name finnguor, of course, is a play-on-words of my name sounding like "finger." My friend who gave me this nickname thinks it's hilarious.)
### i'm a public transportation fan, biker, cool-thing-enthusiast, and (possibly, according to my friends,) a funny person. 

##### i also study systems design engineering at the university of waterloo!

##### in my free time (which I wish I had more of) i write, cook, yap, and try my best to be a functional human being.
### welcome to my connection of notes and written pieces :)
